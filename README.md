# Project A: Cultural and Structural Barriers to Mental Health Support for Asian LGBTQ+ Youth in Aotearoa

## Project Summary 

### Overview
This project investigates the cultural and structural barriers to mental health help-seeking behaviour among Asian LGBTQ+ youth in New Zealand. The analysis uses data from the Youth2000/Y19 survey series and aligns with national policies such as the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy and the Mental Health and Addiction Plan led by Te Whatu Ora.

### Objectives
- Identify patterns of emotional distress and professional help-seeking behaviour among Asian LGBTQ+ youth.
- Analyse how factors like ethnicity, family support, and cultural stigma influence access to mental health services.
- Highlight equity gaps and provide data-driven policy recommendations.

### Data

  - `ethnicity` (Asian, Māori, Pākehā, etc.)
  - `gender_identity` (cis, trans, nonbinary)
  - `sexual_orientation` (hetero, gay, bi, questioning)
  - `emotional_distress_score` (0–20 scale)
  - `help_sought` (yes/no)
  - `help_type` (friend, family, GP, counsellor, none)
  - `parental_support` (Likert scale 1–5)
  - `born_in_nz` (yes/no)

### Methods

- Logistic regression using Statsmodels
- Data visualisation: bar plots, stacked charts, heatmaps

### Policy Relevance
This work directly supports the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy (2019–2029), which prioritises mental health access for marginalised youth. It also contributes evidence for culturally competent services and school-based mental health interventions.
